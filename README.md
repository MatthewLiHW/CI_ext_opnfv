# CI_ext_opnfv
repository for external OPNFV CI projects

This repository is used for OPNFV(open network function virtualization, https://wiki.opnfv.org/) external CI projects.

The puppet scripts used here are to install a jenkin master, zuul(zuul scheduler, zuul merger), gearman, nodepool, etc, in one node.

You can use the official gerrit server in OPNFV, if for your own use, the gerrit server has to be installed by yourself.
